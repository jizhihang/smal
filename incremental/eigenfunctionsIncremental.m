 function [lambda_out,uu2,bins_out,uu,jj] = eigenfunctionsIncremental(DATA,g,lambdas,NUM_EVECS,bins)
% Function that computes approximate smallest NUM_EVECS of graph
% Laplacian of DATA, using eigenfunctions approach from NIPS09 paper:
% "Semi-supervised learning in gigantic image collections"
% by R. Fergus, Y. Weiss and A. Torralba. Note that this method assumes
% that the distribution of DATA is seperable.
%
% Inputs:
%   1. DATA - nPoints x nDims real matrix.
%   2. SIGMA - 1 x 1 real. Affinity between points in graph Laplacian
%   3. NUM_EVECS -  1 x 1 integer. Number of approximate eigenvectors
%   to compute.
%   4. EPSILON (optional) - 1 x 1 real. Default = 0.1. Offset added to
%   histogram in numericalEigenFunctions to avoid divide by 0 problems.
%
%
% Outputs:
%   1. lambda_out - NUM_EVECS x NUM_EVECS diagonal matrix holding
%   approximate eigenvalues of smallest NUM_EVECS eigenvectors.
%   2. uu2 - nPoints x NUM_EVECS real matrix of approximate
%   eigenvectors.
%
%  Example usage:
%   % Compute smallest 5 approximate eigenvectors of graph Laplacian,
%   % using affinity scaling of 0.2:
%   [d,u] = eigenfunctions(data,0.2,5);
%
% This implementation of the numerical eigenfunctions approach is general
% and can be applied to real data (it is a cleaned up version of the
% code used to generate the results in the NIPS paper). Note that it
% does assume seperability of the data, so you might want to preprocess
% it first with PCA. Note that whatever transformation you use must not
% change the distances between points, thus only rotations are
% permitted and things like ICA are not allowed.
%
% If you have new data for which you want to use the same set of
% eigenfunctions, then you just need to do the clipping and the
% interpolation in the existing eigenfunctions (stages 3 & 4) below.
%
% If you do use this code in your paper, please cite our paper. For your
% convenience, here is the bibtex:
